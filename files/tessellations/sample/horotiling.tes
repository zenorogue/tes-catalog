# now we provide the rules to build the tessellation tree.

# treestate 0: the first square in a subtree, with two triangle siblings and their subtrees
treestate(1, PARENT, 2, 1, 3)

# treestate 1: square with a single branch
treestate(1, PARENT, LEFT, 1, RIGHT)

# treestate 2: left triangle with full left tree
treestate(0, PARENT, LEFT, 0)

# treestate 3: right triangle with full right tree
treestate(0, PARENT, 0, RIGHT)

# the first number is shape (treestates 0 and 1 are shape #0 (squares), treestates 2 and 3 are shape #1 (triangles))
# treestate 0 has its PARENT at edge 0, and children in treestates 2, 1, 3
# PARENT always connects to the parent (if a treestate appears as a child of another treestate, it should have 1 PARENT, otherwise it should have 0)
# LEFT connects to the left subtree, RIGHT connects to the rigth subtree

# you can see the resulting tree structure by:
# * loading this tes file
# * experiment with geometry -> size of the world
# * set 'which distance' to 'start'
# * set 'number codes' to 'type'
# * enable 'triangle grid: tree edges'

# (or with commandline: '-tes tessellations/sample/horotiling.tes -canvas A -expansion 2 1 0 -palrgba "g tree" ffffffff')

# you can change the initial treestate -- the default is 0
# first_treestate(3)

# note: Camelot can only be created on cell types which have root treestates (those with no PARENT) assigned to them -- here we have no root treestates, so no Camelot

# Set the default sight range to 7. May be useful for debugging
range(7)

# Make the boundaries narrower. The default is boundary_ratio(1)
boundary_ratio(.2)

# this makes the 'floor stars' appear smaller (while 'cscale' makes everything smaller)
floor_scale(.25)

# make the Yendor challenge more interesting by first doing 50 steps down the tree
yendor_backsteps(50)
